I used AWS Glue ETL, S3, and Tableau to create a dashboard on 1 trillion dollars' worth of Canadian federal contracts.
Observations-
1. Aircraft worth $43B 🛫 were purchased, followed by $27B ⛴️ in boats, as part of $273B in defense contracts.
2. The majority of contracts, totaling $570B, were awarded to Canadian companies or foreign companies operating in Canada 🇨🇦. Only $24B in federal contracts have been allocated to health 🏥 and education 📚 over the past 100 years.
3. Not a single defense contract was awarded to Russia 🇷🇺, whereas China 🇨🇳 and India 🇮🇳 received some.
