I used AWS Glue ETL, S3, and Tableau to create a dashboard on 1 trillion dollars' worth of Canadian federal contracts.
Observations-
1. 43B $ worth aircrafts 🛫 were bought followed by 27B$ ⛴️of boats, out of 273B$ in defence contracts. 
2. Majority of contracts were issued to Canadian Corps(or foreign companies operating in Canada)🇨🇦 amounting 570B$.
3. Just 24B$ federal contracts goes to Health🏥 and Education 📚 in last 100 years, seems like university CAPEX expenditure is outside this dataset.
4. Not even single defence contract goes to Russia🇷🇺 whereas China🇨🇳 & India 🇮🇳 bags some of those.
